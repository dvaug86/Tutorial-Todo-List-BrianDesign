This is yet again another todo list app. I have been a bit out of practice so I plan on knocking out this guy as a little bit of a refresher it is a bit more basic I believe than my 2 remaining ones I want to complete. 
The first one is to refresh me on tailwind since I haven't used it in about 6 months.
The other will involve using a database.

This tutorial is by Brian Design and can be found here:

I really liked this tutorial especially compared to the previous one it felt way more simple and straight forward but not as complex. This guys presentation was a lot more streamlined and not choppy with errors.

for my project I like this guys approach but in order to best accomplish what I'm setting out to do I think I am going to take a little of this one and the cards from the ninja coder db tutorial.
